SkyChat
=======

Super simple chat plugin, 42 lines of code for the entire plugin.

This will set the chat format to the configured value.

In the configured format, `{player}` will be replaced with the player's name, and `{message}` with the player's message. No other substitutions will be made by SkyChat, though other plugins may make them.

To set the format, change the `format` variable in `plugins/SkyChat/config.yml`, then use `/skychatreload` to reload the chat format.
